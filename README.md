Concept:
I wanted to create a toy sharing app for families that want to
share their kids' toys with other families.
I wanted the user to be able to upload an image of the toy and write some information about it and post it to the website. If any other user likes the toy, they can request to use it.
There is no restriction on who can request for the toy, i.e the user doesnt have to post/share their toy.

The stretch goals for the app would be to allow the users to upload images of their toys and have the location of the user show up on a map through a google map api. This would help users to
 borrower/share toys with folks closer to them. I would also love to add a third party api like Mailchimp so that the users get notifications if someone wants to share their toy.
